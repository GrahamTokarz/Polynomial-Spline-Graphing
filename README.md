# Polynomial-Spline-Graphing
A work in progress that will be used to implement polynomial spline mapping to move an autonomous robot efficiently

This project was all self-created code that creates a graph with zoom controls in Java GUIs. It also implements a file read and writing system.
In the future, it will be developed further more with more user-friendly GUIs, and communication with a robot in order to move the robot along the path currently displayed by the graph.
This project is a cooperation with another student who is working on the mechanical side of the operation.
